* *"Well, regarding the name, Cabal is indeed the library that all tools use, e.g. the .cabal file in a project. The bad name here is the build tool "cabal-install" because that has confused the hell out of everyone. There's three things here: a library called Cabal, a build tool called "Stack", and a build tool that should be called "some-haskell-build-tool" like maybe "haskbuilder" but is instead called "cabal-install" because it is some-build-tool-that-uses-the-Cabal-library (although that description works for Stack too). So the two tools with cabal in the name confuse everyone."*

* A nice desc of UTXOs - The MobileCoin blockchain is the source of truth for the allocation of value. It consists of an ordered collection of transaction outputs, organized into blocks. Each transaction output ("txo") has a unique corresponding construction called a key image. Every txo initially appears in the blockchain in a spendable state, as an unspent transaction output or utxo. Every successful payment consumes some utxos as inputs and creates new utxos as outputs. When a utxo is consumed, its corresponding key image is permanently added to the blockchain, ensuring that it can not be spent a second time
